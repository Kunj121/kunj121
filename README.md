🧑‍🎓 About Me

Hello! I'm Kunj, currently pursuing Master's student in Financial Mathematics at the University of Chicago. My passion lies in the intersection of quantitative finance, data analytics, and algorithmic trading. With a background in finance, mathematics, and programming, I'm constantly exploring new ways to extract insights from financial markets and build systematic trading strategies. The project below are a few assignments and work I have done throughout the past year! 


⚡️ Energy Analysis (**In Progress**)

Taking this quarter to learn about the Energy markets and the ins and outs of the Smart Grid

Will be committing different analysis's throught these next months

Stay tuned...more repos to come!


Here are some of the exciting projects currently in development:

📈 Relative Volume Momentum Quantitative Trading Strategy)

Developing a real-time trading strategy relative volume utilizing Alpaca

Testing and optimizing execution logic for PnL

Pulling On-Chain/historical data for PoS crypto currencies from Dune and Coin API

Implementing an MLP model to predict signals (buy/hold/sell)

🔢 C++ Options Pricing Engine (Optimized)

Creating a options calculator for American Options

Utilizing Numerical Methods to price options

⚡ Nanosecond-Level BTC/USD Market Analysis

Analyzed nanosecond-level data for BTC/USD over a one-day period 📉

Conducted Monte Carlo simulations tuning the quoted participation rate between 2% and 5%

Visualized the impact using Seaborn, observing how participation levels influence the difference between the executed VWAP and the arrival price 📊

🔁 CIP Arbitrage Strategy Replication

Replicated the Covered Interest Parity (CIP) arbitrage strategy using historical FX and interest rate data 💱

📌 Built a full end-to-end pipeline using pydoit for seamless data ingestion, processing, and analysis

Executed arbitrage detection logic, identifying mispricings between spot and forward FX markets vs interest rate differentials 📈

Validated strategy across multiple currency pairs, generating insights on arbitrage windows and inefficiencies in the CIP condition
